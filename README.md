        [NOTE: 7 August 2024: This repository is a work in progress. Check back periodically for updates.]

Documents included in this repository are brief excerpts from the texts associated with the principal thinkers and teachers discussed in this class.  The excerpts will give you something of the flavor of their thought, but if you are interested, you will probably want to go on and read more.  Below I have listed a few authoritative translations of these texts.
